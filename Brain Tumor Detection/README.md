## Summary
This project involves the development of a deep learning model to detect brain tumors using X-ray images. The goal of the project was to create an accurate and efficient tool for detecting brain tumors that can help healthcare professionals make faster and more accurate diagnoses.

## Approach
The project used a dataset of X-ray images of brain scans, including both normal scans and scans with tumors. The dataset was preprocessed and augmented to improve the quality and quantity of the data. The project used the TensorFlow library to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn features from the images and make predictions about the presence of tumors.

## Results
The project achieved an accuracy of more than 95% on a test set of X-ray images. The trained model was able to correctly identify most of the brain tumors in the test set, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach.

## Impact
This project has the potential to improve the accuracy and speed of brain tumor diagnoses, which can help healthcare professionals make better decisions about patient care. The project also demonstrates the potential of machine learning to support medical imaging analysis and diagnosis.

## Skills
This project involved skills such as data preprocessing, data augmentation, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, and model evaluation.
